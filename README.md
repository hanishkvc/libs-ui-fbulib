# fbulib - a simple framebuffer ui library

Provides a set of UI functions which work on framebuffer devices.

## Scratch the Itch

It is based on my very old framebuffer and other gui related simple
functions. Inturn I had restrucuted/re-implemented/... it and used 
it as part of a nook tablet based code, when I had done some hacking 
on nook tablet in 2011 or 2012.
